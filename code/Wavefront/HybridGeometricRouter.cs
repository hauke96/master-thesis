             *      both are at 180°.
             *      If one neighbor is at 0° and one at 180°, then we're dealing with collinear neighbors. In this case,
             *      one neighbor must be the wavelets root vertex. This means, that a new wavelet is needed with an
             *      angle area of 0° width towards the other neighbor, which is not the root vertex.
             *      If the neighbors are both at 180°, then they are both equal to the wavelets root and therefore
             *      the wavelet reached the end of a line segment. In this case, the new wavelet will have an angle
             *      area of 360° width, because the propagation is not bounded by any edge between the neighbors.
             * 
             *   2. The neighbors are either on the west or east side. This means that a new wavelet might be needed but
             *      it can also mean that the currentVertex is an inner corner and therefore no new wavelet is needed.
             *      To determine, whether the currentVertex is an inner corner or not, depends on the angles of the
             *      wavelet.
             *      The "else if"-blocks below describe the mechanism used to determine inner corners in more detail.

             *      V         V = Vertex (one of the neighbors)
             *       \

             *        R       R = Root of wavelet and also a neighbors
             * 
             * Let V (an arbitrary unvisited vertex) and R (root of wavelet) both be neighbors and both on the west
             * side of an imaginary vertical line through R and X. Let's say the wavelet from R reached vertex X and has
             * an angle-area of 0° to 90° and that V is at 270° relative to X. Because both neighbors are on the west
             * side, we know, that the segment (X, V) does not cast a shadow. We also know, that this means, that
             * there's a need for an wavelet rooted in X with an angle area of 270° to 360°.
             *
             * Let's consider a different scenario where the wavelet rooted in R goes from 270° to 360°. In this case,
             * both neighbors and the wavelets angle area are all on the west side. This means the vertex X is an inner
             * corner since the wavelets angle area includes the segment (X, V).
             * In a case where V has been visited, this would be registered as a shadow cast by the segment (X, V). But
