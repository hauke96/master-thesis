This is a copy of the internal GeometrySnapper.SnapTransformer class from the NetTopologySuite. The original class
is used via the GeometrySnapper.SnapTo method. However, this method calls the very inefficient
GeometrySnapper.ExtractTargetCoordinates method, which causes a huge performance overhead.
