# DatasetCreator

This project is used to create artificial datasets with a repeating pattern.
The pattern must be located in `./resources/pattern.geojson` (relative to the working directory of the executed project).
Just execute the `DatasetCreator.dll` without parameters to get usage information.

See (on the `performance-evaluation` branch) the `/evaluation/README.md` for more information on how these created datasets are used.
