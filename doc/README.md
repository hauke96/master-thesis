This folder contains additional information on the code and the algorithm.
Most of it can be found in the thesis and code itself, some parts (especially older and deprecated things) can be found here.

* [TERMINOLOGY.md](./doc/TERMINOLOGY.md) contains definition for certain terms used in other documentation and the code.
* [DESIGN_DECISIONS.md](./doc/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md) describes several decisions on things like data structures and optimizations as well as possible alternatives and implementations that are no longer used.
* [ALGORITHMS.md](./doc/ALGORITHMS.md) gives an overview on the main algorithms used.
