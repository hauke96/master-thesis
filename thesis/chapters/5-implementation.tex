\section{Frameworks}

% Why what framework? Only if interesting

\section{Wavefront/Visibility Graph}

% Any special features of .NET used? What features used from MARS?

\section{Combination of routing algorithms}

	This section describes the core aspect of this thesis:
	The combination of network and geometric based routing algorithms.
	
	In the following subsections, four approaches are discussed of which the last one seemed to be the most promising.
	The first three are using any normal network based routing algorithm, like A* or Dijkstra, in combination with the geometric continuous Dijkstra paradigm.
	Only the last and further pursued approach uses visibility graphs for routing.

	% Ad-hoc creation of edges by stopping A* and continuing with wavefront algorithm
	\subsection{Ad-hoc generation of edges}
	
	% Concurrent routing: Use A* and wavefront in parallel and merge the results
	\subsection{Concurrent routing}
	
	% Concurrent routing for segments (e.g. start new routing calls every 100m)
	\subsection{Concurrent routing on smaller segments}
	
	% Merge of networks
	\subsection{Merge an existing network with a visibility graph}
