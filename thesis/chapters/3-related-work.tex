% Routing
	% Shortest paths among obstacles in the plane (Mitchell, 1993)
	% An Optimal Algorithm for Euclidean Shortest Paths in the Plane (Hershberger, Suri, 1999)
	% maybe: Efficient algorithms for Euclidean shortest path and visibility problems with polygonal obstacles (Kapoor, Maheshwari, 1988)

% Pedestrian path finding
	% online routing: A Navigation Algorithm for Pedestrian Simulation in Dynamic Environments (Teknomo, Millonig, 2007)
	% maybe: pure geometric/geodesic approach with navigation fields: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/12/4/043032/pdf
	% unified pedestrian routing (they use the above navigation field graph generation): A Unified Pedestrian Routing Model for Graph-Based Wayfinding Built on Cognitive Principles (Kielar, et al. 2017)
	
% Geodata and networks
	% maybe, they use geom. routing to fill OSM gaps: Automatic extrapolation of missing road network data in OpenStreetMap (Funke, Schirrmeister, Storandt, 2015)
	% with some assumptions like no dollinear vertices: Constructing the visibility graph for n-line segments in O(nÂ²) time (Emo Welzl, 1985)
