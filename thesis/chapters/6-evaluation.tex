In this chapter, the implementation of the hybrid routing algorithm is evaluated regarding performance, correctness and usefulness.
Next to the actual results, methods and design details on the evaluation are given as well.

\section{Performance evaluation}

	The performance evaluation uses different datasets to measure graph generation times, routing times and memory consumption.

	\subsection{Methods \& Measurements}

		\subsubsection{Collected data}
		
			The collected data consists of time and memory usage measurement, of which the time measurements are on the level of separate methods.
			Also, the amount of data is measures, namely the number of edges and vertices at various steps in the process, as well as the length of routes, which includes the beeline and actual route distances.
		
		\subsubsection{Datasets}
		\label{subsubsec:eval-datasets}
		
			Two overall types of datasets are used:
			Pattern-based datasets are created using a recurring pattern of various sizes.
			OSM-based datasets use differently sized extracts from OpenStreetMap.
			While the OSM-based datasets contain obstacles and roads (except in the \enquote{without roads/obstacles} datasets), the pattern-based datasets do no contain any roads.
			
			For both types, several categories of datasets exist with different properties:
			\begin{description}
				\item[Maze pattern] Datasets with touching and collinear linestrings forming a maze-like structure.
				\item[Rectangle pattern] Datasets with numerous differently sized, positioned and rotated rectangles.
				\item[Circle pattern] dataset with differently sized circles having a large amount of vertices.
				\item[OSM city] Real-world extracts from the OpenStreetMap database with data from the city of Hamburg, Germany. The data has been filtered to remove all over- and underground features.
				\item[OSM rural] Equivalent to the \enquote{OSM city} dataset, but located outside the city of Hamburg and therefore containing more natural obstacles (lakes, ditches, forest), more open spaces and less regular distributed buildings.
				\item[OSM export without roads] OSM extracts but without roads.
				\item[OSM export without obstacles] Analogous to the \enquote{without roads} datasets, but without any obstacles, i.e. buildings, walls and natural areas such as lakes and forests.
			\end{description}
			The \enquote{OSM city} and \enquote{OSM rural} categories each contain six dataset of the sizes 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 and 4 km\textsuperscript{2}.
			The two OSM categories \enquote{without roads/obstacles} both use the 4 km\textsuperscript{2} datasets from the city and rural categories.
			All OSM-based dataset are filtered to not contains any over- or underground features, because the hybrid routing algorithm was not made to handle this third spatial dimension.

			\end{figure}
		
		\subsubsection{Optimizations}
		
			As described in \Cref{chap:implementation}, there are several optimizations made to the implementation.
			Some of which are on the level of data structures, some on an algorithmic level.
			The effectiveness of these optimization was evaluated using the 4 km\textsuperscript{2} \enquote{OSM city} dataset.
			Each of the following optimizations was deactivated or replaced for the evaluation:

			\begin{description}
				\item[Shadow areas] Instead, every visibility check was performed using the custom intersection check described in \Cref{subsubsec:intersection-checks}.
				\item[Custom intersection check] The custom intersection check was replaced by the \texttt{RobustLineIntersector} class from the NTS to determine intersections between line segments.
				\item[BinIndex] Instead, the \texttt{Bintree} from the NTS was used.
				\item[Convex hull] The restriction to only consider vertices on the convex hull of obstacles was removed.
				\item[Valid angle areas] Considering only potential visibility neighbors within certain angular ranges was deactivated.
				\item[kNN search] Instead, all visibility neighbors in all directions were determined.
			\end{description}		
			
		\subsubsection{Measurement method}
		
			Measuring the performance was done by a small agent-based simulation project called \texttt{HikerModel}, consisting of one agent consecutively visiting a given list of coordinates (routing waypoints) and using a given dataset as input to the hybrid routing algorithm.
			The coordinates are given via a linestring within a GeoJSON file, of which each coordinate of the linestring is visited by the agent in order.
			Each waypoint was within the range of the dataset, meaning each coordinate was surrounded by obstacles.
			The euclidean distances (beeline distances) of the line segments within this linestring were distributed evenly to measure the required routing time relative to the distance and dataset size.
			
			Because the OSM datasets within one category cover differently sized areas, each waypoint linestring of an OSM-based dataset contains all waypoints of the next smaller one plus some additional ones.
			This means that the waypoints of the smallest dataset are used by every other dataset as well.
		
		\subsubsection{Technical considerations}
		
			The measurement was done by an auxiliary class \texttt{PerformanceMeasurement}, which provides a method that mesaures the execution time of a passed function delegate.
			
			As part of its memory management, C\#/.NET uses automatic garbage collection adding unavoidable noise to the measurements.
			Unfortunately the garbage collector cannot be turned off and controlling it is only partially possible.
			
			Prior to each measurement, the garbage collector was triggered with the goal to provide equal circumstances to all iterations.
			This was done by the \texttt{GC.Collect()} and \texttt{GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers()} methods of the .NET framework.
			Using these two methods forces a garbage collection and waits for it to finish\footnote{\url{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.gc.waitforpendingfinalizers?view=net-7.0}}.
			
			To prevent the garbage collection from interfering with the execution, a 256 MiB large no-GC-region is placed around the measured function call via \texttt{GC.TryStartNoGCRegion(256 * 1024 * 1024)}.
			Introducing this no-GC-region noticeably reduced noise in the measured times.
		
			C\#/.NET also uses \term*[just-in-time compilation]{just-in-time} (\term*{JIT}) compilation changing the code during runtime, which potentially yields different measurements for subsequent method calls.
			JIT compilation can not be turned off for normal .NET executions via the command \texttt{dotnet program.dll}.
			An alternative would be the usage of \term*[]ahead-of-time compilation]{ahead-of-time} (\term*{AOT}) compilation, which has a negative impact on the performance of LINQ operations\footnote{\url{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/?tabs=net7}}, which are frequently used in the implementation.
			Because both compilation strategies have disadvantages, the default JIT compilation was chosen.
			
			The dynamic behavior of JIT compilation was mitigated by calling the measured function three times without storing the measurement results (warm-ups) before executing it five times and storing these last five results.
			This ensures that any JIT compilation and garbage collection of prior code was performed during the warm-up iterations and interfered with the actual iteration as little as possible.
			
			Another step to get stable and reproducible results was the increase of the process priority to exclusively use one CPU core on which the single threaded application ran.
			Increasing the process priority was done by settings the \texttt{Thread.CurrentThread.Priority} to \texttt{ProcessPriorityClass.High}, which required root permissions on Linux systems.
		
		\subsubsection{System and hardware}
		
			The measurements were performed on an up-to-date Arch Linux operating system (Kernel 6.4.3) with .NET Core 7.0.107 and MARS framework 4.5.2.
			Apart from necessary operating system processes and a minimal desktop environment, no other applications ran during the performance measurements.
			
			The hardware consisted of an octa core Intel\textregistered\ Xeon\textregistered\ E3-1231 v3 CPU at 3.40 GHz, a total of 16GB DDR3 1333 MHz RAM and a Samsung EVO 850 SSD.
			However, the whole algorithm and the \texttt{HikerModel} simulation is single threaded.
			File system operations are only performed to initially load the input data and to write the measurement results after completing all executions.
	
\section{Performance evaluation}

	In this section the results of the performance evaluation of the hybrid routing algorithm are presented.
	First the OSM-based datasets are discussed followed by the artificial pattern-based datasets.

	\subsection{OSM-based datasets}
		
		\subsubsection{Import and graph generation}
		
			A few aspects regarding the runtime behavior can be inferred from the general graph generation times shown in \Cref{fig:eval-import-city} and \Cref{fig:eval-import-rural}.
			First, as mentioned at the beginning of \Cref{subsec:related-work:visibility-graph}, the process of generating a visibility graph has an inherent quadratic runtime.
			This fact is clearly visible in the import measurements shown in \Cref{fig:eval-import-city-abs} and \Cref{fig:eval-import-rural-abs}, even though it is less prominent in the \enquote{OSM rural} datasets.
%			Details on the contribution of each task to the overall graph generation time discussed below.
			Second, \Cref{fig:eval-import-city-rel} and \ref{fig:eval-import-rural-rel} show an increase in the per-vertex processing time, which not necessarily grows quadratic as the \enquote{OSM rural} dataset shows.

				\caption{Graph generation times by task for the OSM-based datasets.}
				\label{fig:eval-import-details}
			\end{figure}
			
			In \Cref{fig:eval-import-details} both OSM dataset import times are split into the performed tasks.
			The task with the largest effort in terms of the required time differs from the dataset category.
			
			In the \enquote{OSM city} datasets, the \term*[k-nearest neighbors]{$k$ nearest neighbor} (\term*{kNN}) search is the most time consuming task with a share on the total time of constantly over 60\%.
			The second most time consuming task is the merge operation, where visibility and road edges are merged.
			Together, these two steps are responsible for over 98.1\% of the total graph generation time throughout all \enquote{OSM city} datasets.
			
			Different proportions of the tasks can be seen in the \enquote{OSM rural} category.
			Here, the merge operation is the more time consuming task with a share of at least 51.4\% on the overall graph generation time.
			This effect of a more time-consuming merge operation is further discussed in \Cref{subsubsec:dataset-without-roads-obstacles}.
			The times of the kNN search and the merge operation sum up to at least 96.5\% of the graph generation time.
			
			Even though the order which task is the more time consuming is different, both times of the kNN search and the merge operation are the most significant ones.
			The graph creation task in the \enquote{OSM rural} datasets is the only additional task throughout all tasks in all OSM-based datasets with a share of over 1\%.
			All other tasks have a negligible share on the total graph generation time of below 1\%, which decrease with the size of the dataset.
	
		\subsubsection{Routing}
		
			Routing consists of several tasks with varying degrees of impact on the total routing time.
			The time required for a routing task is influenced by two main factors.
			First, the dataset size is a strong influencing factor but has differently large impacts on the time of the routing tasks.
			Second, the structure of the data, meaning the number, size and distribution of obstacles, also influences the required time for routing.
			In fact, the size of the dataset is the strongest influence on the overall routing time as it affects all tasks during routing.
			\Cref{fig:eval-city-routing-details} and \ref{fig:eval-rural-routing-details} show the routing times from the \enquote{OSM city} and \enquote{OSM rural} datasets as well as details on the separate tasks during routing.
			
			Starting with the total routing times, both categories show different runtime behavior in terms of the route length.
			While the \enquote{OSM city} datasets shows no correlation between the beeline distance and the routing time, the \enquote{OSM rural} dataset shows a negative correlation (longer distance means shorter routing time).
			
			This negative correlation is most prominent in the largest \enquote{OSM rural} dataset between the first and the fifth routing request.
			Since the majority of the time is needed to connect the source and destination locations to the graph, the presence of nearby obstacles has a significant impact on the routing time.
			As illustrated in \Cref{fig:eval-osm-rural-map}, the destination vertex of the first routing request has no nearby obstacles.
			This means no efficient use of shadow areas can be made resulting in more visibility checks and therefore slower runtime.
			The destination vertex of the fifth request has multiple obstacles nearby casting large shadow areas towards many buildings, which then do not need to be further checked.
			As a result, 86 visibility edges are connected to the source vertex of the first and 18 to the source vertex of the fifth request.
			
			This phenomenon of longer routing times for routing between short distant vertices does not appear in the \enquote{OSM city} dataset due to the high density of obstacles enabling an efficient use of shadow areas.
			But the effect is still visible in \Cref{fig:eval-city-routing-details-a} at the requests with a beeline distance between 0.5km and 1km.
			Requests in this range, which have a longer processing time, contain vertices at junctions or wide roads with only a few surrounding obstacles, which yields longer processing times.

		\subsubsection{Dataset without roads or obstacles}
		\label{subsubsec:dataset-without-roads-obstacles}
		
			The normal OSM-based datasets contain both, roads and obstacles.
			However, datasets containing only roads or only obstacles are thinkable and can also be used with the hybrid routing algorithm.
			For this evaluation, the 4km\textsuperscript{2} datasets of the \enquote{OSM city} and \enquote{OSM rural} categories were filtered yielding three datasets for each category:
			The normal dataset, one without roads and one without obstacles.
			In the dataset without roads, all road edges were removed which do not cross buildings, meaning building passages remained within this dataset to ensure the reachability of backyards.
			Influences of the two filters are discussed in the following.

			Some noteworthy insights can be inferred from these data:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The kNN search and visibility graph creation times were significantly reduced for the dataset without obstacles, which is expected, since both operations take only obstacles into account.
				\item The merge operation for the dataset without roads took longer compared to the dataset without obstacles.
				This is due to the 175 remaining building passages within the \enquote{no roads} dataset, which means this operation still merged road edges and therefore required some time.
				However, compared to the normal dataset, the merge operation of the \enquote{no road} dataset only required 25.63\% of the time, which does not match the number of remaining road edges of 4.82\% (175 edges) compared to the normal dataset (3629 edges).\\
				Because building passages consist of short segments, their start and end vertices (dead-end vertices) need to be connected to the rest of the graph.
				This requires the creation of visibility edges, which is an expensive operation.
				The normal dataset contains 742 and the dataset without roads (and only building passages) still 346 such dead-end vertices, which yields the relatively long merge operation time.
				\item In the \enquote{no obstacles} dataset the merge operation took 0.4\% of the normal time. It is a low but expected value, because no visibility edges exist and therefore no merge of edges took place.

				\item A comparison of the kNN search and road merge operations of the normal dataset shows that the merge operation actually took 10.77\% longer than the kNN search.
				Results of the normal \enquote{OSM city} dataset shows the opposite relation with 61.97\% less time required for the merge operation.
				A possible explanation is the ratio of road to visibility edges, which is 1:33 for the city dataset (33 visibility edges per road edge) and 1:264 for the rural dataset.
				This means that more intersections per road edges were processed using the rural dataset, which was actually the case:
				Using the city dataset the number of road edges increased due to splitting at intersections by a factor of 66 and within the rural dataset by a factor of 221.
				Therefore, the time spent on one road edge was significantly higher within the rural dataset and likely lead to the significant increase in time required for the merge operation.
				\item The graph creation time using the \enquote{no roads} dataset is especially noteworthy since it shows an \emph{increase} in processing time compared to the normal dataset.
				Because no algorithmic reason exists that would result in an increase of the graph generation time and because the measurements contains outliers, no further investigation took place to find an explanation for this increase.
			\end{itemize}
			Apart these differences and unique characteristics, both dataset categories show similar results for the kNN search, graph generation and overall processing time.
			First of all, removing all obstacles eliminates the main complexity and therefore significantly decreases the processing time.
			Decreasing their amount will therefore significantly reduce the processing time due to the overall quadratic runtime complexity of the kNN search.
			Second, removing roads does not affect the kNN search and graph creation but the total processing time decreases due to the faster merge operation.
			Third, even though it is not a significant part of the processing time in the first place, getting obstacles and adding attributes to POIs is also reduced when removing obstacles or roads.
	
	\subsection{Pattern-based datasets}
	
		\subsubsection{Import and graph generation}
		
			The pattern-based datasets contain repeating patterns of obstacles and thus have a much more regular structure compared to OSM-based datasets.
			This is also reflected in the results of the graph generation containing less deviations as shown in \Cref{fig:eval-import-pattern-abs}.
			Due to the absence of roads, the overall graph generation time is mainly determined by the kNN search.
			Only smaller datasets of up to an input vertex count of about 3,500 (depending on the dataset category) show a combined time of all other tasks of up to 5\% on the total graph generation time.
			All datasets show the already mentioned quadratic runtime complexity of the kNN search and no anomalies were observers during the overall graph generation.
			Detailed absolute and relative times for the maze dataset can be seen in \Cref{fig:eval-import-pattern-maze-abs-rel}.

				\label{fig:eval-import-pattern-maze-abs-rel}
			\end{figure}
		
		\subsubsection{Routing}
		
			Because the pattern-based datasets did not contain any roads, routing times in these datasets solely depend on the size of the visibility graph and therefore on the time required to connect the source and destination vertices, which is the most time consuming task during routing.
			Connecting vertices uses the kNN search of the graph generation and therefore its runtime also increases quadratically with the number of vertices in the graph.
			
			The A* algorithm uses this quadratically growing graph and therefore shows a quadratic runtime as well.
			However, this quadratic runtime is not clearly visible in all measurements and a linear regression on the maze- and rectangle-based measurements yield a similarly good correlation.
			The effect of a quadratic complexity might therefore only be significant in larger datasets.

			\label{fig:eval-memory-usage}
		\end{figure}
	
		In this section, the memory usage of the hybrid routing algorithm is analyzed using the 4km\textsuperscript{2} \enquote{OSM city} dataset as presented in \Cref{fig:eval-memory-usage}.
		
		Until the creation of the visibility graph (3) the memory requirement only shows a very slight linear increase due to simple mapping without new and larger data structures.
		With the start of the merge operation (4), the memory usage rises due to additional data structures and newly added vertices and edges to the graph.
		The period between (4 to 5) determined dead-end road vertices, which are connected with new nodes separately to the graph.
		Merging road edges (5 to 6) then introduces many new nodes and edges due to the large number of intersections.
		Routing requests (6 to 7) do also require a certain amount of memory and the garbage collection regularly frees up the memory of prior requests resulting in recurring spikes in the memory usage.
		
		Possible memory optimizations and other performance improvements are discussed in \Cref{sec:future-work}.
		
	\subsection{Optimizations}
	
		Impacts of the implemented optimizations were measured using the 0.5km\textsuperscript{2} \enquote{OSM city} dataset as listed in \Cref{table:optimization-impact}.
		Noteworthy is the discrepancy between the product of all speedup/slowdown factors and the overall speedup of about 71 when all optimizations are active.
		Activating all optimizations should, according to the separate speedup factors on the right side of \Cref{table:optimization-impact}, result in a speedup of over 255 but only 71 can be observed.
		This is because the filtering methods interfere with each other.
		When a vertex if filtered out by one filtering method, it reduces the efficiency of the other filtering methods.
		Therefore, the selective (de)activation of single optimizations yields a differently strong impact than the (de)activation of all optimizations together.

		\end{table}
		
		Some filtering optimizations presented in \Cref{chap:implementation}, namely the convex hull and valid angle area filtering, remove vertices that might be useful when determining non-shortest but otherwise optimal paths based on a custom weighting.
		Deactivating these two optimizations results in a measured slowdown factor of about 1.9.
		
\section{Route correctness and quality}

	\subsection{Weight function}
	
		Before the correctness and quality of the routes are discussed, a brief introduction into the functioning of the weight function is given.
		
		When determining true shortest paths, the length of an edge is its weight, which should be minimized in order to obtain the shortest path.
		Whenever certain edges should be preferred or avoided, a factor is determined based on the edges attributes.
		Due to the minimization algorithm a factor lower one means an edge is preferred, a factor greater one rather avoids those edges.
		A factor of positive infinity on an edge $e$ completely avoids this edge since any other path has a lower total weight than a path containing $e$.
		
		The implementation of the hybrid visibility graph provides three routing methods.
		One determined the true shortest path (all weight factors are one), one determines a weighted path (factor of 0.8 for road edges) and one accepts a custom weight function.
		
		All following analyses use the predefined weight function with a factor of 0.8 on road edges.
		The factor 0.8 is chosen rather arbitrarily but yields routes where the agent does indeed switch between road and visibility edges.
		Impacts of different weight factors on the resulting paths are discussed in the following \hyperref[subsubsec:manual-route-analysis]{manual route analysis}.

	\subsection{Correctness}
	\label{subsec:correctness}
	
		In this section, theoretic considerations on the correctness of the hybrid routing algorithm are presented, which therefore does not include mistakes in the implementation.
		The hybrid routing algorithm is considered \emph{correct} if the resulting path between any two given locations is the shortest possible path with respect to the obstacles of the dataset and the given weight function.
		In the following the weight function represents the distance of edges to find truly shortest paths.
		
		Edges in the generated visibility graph represent shortest segments between vertices of obstacles.
		In other words, for any two vertices $v$ and $v'$, a visibility edge $e=(v, v')$ is the shortest possible connection between these two vertices.
		A shortest path through a visibility graph is therefore equal to a shortest geometric path around obstacles in the plain.
		
		For shortest path algorithms, such as A* or Dijkstra, the term \emph{correct} refers to the fact that their result is the shortest possible path between two vertices in a graph.
		Using a correct graph-based shortest path algorithm in a visibility graph yields the shortest path in the plain.
		Regarding the shortest path between existing vertices, the hybrid visibility routing is therefore considered correct.
		
		In addition to routing on a visibility graph, the presented hybrid routing algorithm actively connects locations to the graph as part of answering the routing query yielding a temporarily augmented graph.
		This means the resulting path $p$ from a newly added vertex $s$ to a newly added vertex $t$ contains two additional new edges $e_s=(s, v_s)$ and $e_t=(v_t, t)$, which are not part of the normal non-augmented hybrid visibility graph, resulting in $p=\left\langle s, v_s, ..., v_t, t \right\rangle$.
		The correctness of the path from $v_s$ to $v_t$ follows from the argumentation above.
		The edges $e_s$ and $e_t$ are visibility edges and the correctness argument applies to them as well, meaning that the overall path $p$ is shortest on the augmented visibility graph and therefore shortest in the plain with the presence of obstacles.
		Therefore, the overall hybrid routing algorithm is considered to be correct.
		
		One noteworthy aspect is the filtering of vertices, as described in \Cref{subsec:step-2-knn-search}, which might result in missing edges.
		However, these filters are solely performance optimizations and can be deactivated without negative effects on the algorithms functioning, except the performance.
		
	\subsection{Quality of routes}
	
		\subsubsection{Definition and measurement of route quality}
	
			An ideal route, meaning a route of maximum quality, would exactly match a path chosen by a real pedestrian.
			To approximate a real pedestrian, the expected paths used in the following sections were obtained using aerial imagery, data contained in OSM and local knowledge.
			Therefore, an expected path is realistically walkable in the real world and would likely be chosen by actual pedestrians.
			This also means that an expected path contains a certain subjective component, for example the exact location of a road crossing, the preference of shortcuts via unpaved areas or the avoidance of steps.
			Therefore, the quality analysis of routes uses mathematical metrics as well as a manual analysis.
		
		% How realistic are the routes (= can I go there in real life)? If not: Why not?
		\subsubsection{Manual route analysis}
		\label{subsubsec:manual-route-analysis}
		
			\begin{wrapfigure}[13]{r}{0.5\textwidth}
				\vspace{-2.5\baselineskip}
				\begin{figcenter}
					\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/qgis-routing-osterstrasse}
				\end{figcenter}
				\caption[Comparison of normal routing with hybrid visibility routing.]{Graph-based route (red), hybrid routing algorithm result (blue) and the expected route (green). The dashed part of the expected result is an equally good alternative route.}
				\label{fig:eval-osterstrasse}
			\end{wrapfigure}
		
			In the following examples, routes determined by graph-based routing and the hybrid routing algorithm are compared against an expected result.
			This expected route was created based on OpenStreetMap data, aerial imagery and also local knowledge.
			It was \emph{not} created to intentionally match the results from the hybrid routing algorithm.
		
			% From motivation
			The first situation, shown in \Cref{fig:eval-osterstrasse}, illustrates the problem of missing edges for graph-based algorithms.
			The square \enquote{Fanny-Mendelssohn Platz} in Hamburg, Germany, is a mostly unconnected area and therefore not traversable by graph-based algorithms.
			A routing request using GraphHopper\footnote{\url{https://www.osm.org/directions?engine=graphhopper\_foot\&route=53.57657,9.95210;53.57601,9.95268}} yields the red route, which does not cross the square due to missing edges and therefore takes a detour.
			The hybrid routing algorithm (blue path) does not completely match the expected route but is a better approximation than the graph-based result.
			Next to this example, analyzing routes determined within the 1km\textsuperscript{2} \enquote{OSM city} dataset yields some noteworthy findings.
			
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The route quality significantly decreases with missing or wrong data as shown in \Cref{fig:eval-osterstrasse} as well as \Cref{fig:eval-city-usefulness-b} to \ref{fig:eval-city-usefulness-c}.
				Red passages are not usable in the real world, often traversing private areas, which usually contain obstacles such as fences or vegetation.
				As described in \Cref{subsubsec:data-not-in-osm}, data of private areas in OSM is often sparse resulting in these unrealistic routes.
				\item Within densely built-up areas, larger open spaces are rare and the combination of roads and buildings form corridors in which routes tend to lie.
				When and how often a route determined by the hybrid routing algorithm follows a road depends on the weighting function.
				\item Larger roads result in wide obstacle-free corridor areas, in which unrealistic road crossings might appear.
				Such situation can be seen in \Cref{fig:eval-city-road-crossing} with crossings over a six-lane road, which would be dangerous and unrealistic for real-world pedestrians.
				\item The weight function has a huge impact on the route quality.
				The weighting factors used in this work specify how strongly roads should be preferred, which is illustrated in \Cref{fig:eval-city-weights} with the same route using different weights for road edges.
				Adjusting and defining fine-grained weight functions may help to improve the route quality.
				\item In the \enquote{OSM city} datasets with only smaller open areas, graph-based routes and routes determined by the hybrid routing algorithm were often similar and some parts are even identical.

			% Interesting passages from the rural dataset
			\noindent
			Figures \Cref{fig:eval-rural-routing-6} and \ref{fig:eval-rural-graph-based-comparison} give some examples on routes in a rural area with large open spaces.
			Two findings can be inferred from the analysis of the rural routing results.
			
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Datasets with larger open areas and irregular distributed obstacles, as in the \enquote{OSM rural} datasets, can greatly benefit from the hybrid routing algorithm because graph-based routes might take long detours due to a sparse road network.
				\item The difference between graph-based routes and routes from the hybrid routing algorithm is significantly larger.
				They might not have any location in common and graph-based routes tend to be significantly longer.
				This can be seen in \Cref{fig:eval-rural-graph-based-comparison-6} with a 1.73 km long graph-based and 0.67km long expected route.
				\Cref{fig:eval-rural-graph-based-comparison-17} shows a similar behavior even though the difference in distance is smaller because the graph-based, expected and actual route share common parts.
				\item The accuracy and therefore the usefulness for real-world applications (such as navigation apps) heavily relies on the amount of details in the dataset.
				\Cref{fig:eval-rural-routing-6-osm} illustrates the problem of missing data, which are in this case missing ditches within the farmland.
				The determined route has a length of 365m while the shortest possible route (determined using aerial imagery as seen in \Cref{fig:eval-rural-routing-6-aerial}) is 677m long.

			In general the manual route analysis showed that the route quality is determined by two main factors:
			The quality (mainly completeness) of the data and the weighting factor.
			For densely built-up city datasets the routes might still be good, even though a graph-based routing algorithm might yield similar routes.
		
		\subsubsection{Mathematical route quality analysis}
		
			Two mathematical approaches were used to obtain quantifiable results on the route quality.
			This was done by comparing the expected route to the graph-based and hybrid routing algorithm results.
			The first metric uses the beeline distance between two waypoints and compares it to the distances of the three corresponding routes.
			The second metric uses the Hausdorff distance (described below) to obtain a numeric similarity between the expected route and the two corresponding routing results.
			Both comparisons were performed on the first ten routing requests of the city and rural OSM datasets.
			
			\Cref{fig:eval-route-distances} shows the relation between route and the beeline distances.
			The hybrid routing algorithm creates the shortest routes on average, which tend to be even shorter than the expected routes.
			Even though determining shortest routes is the overall goal, it indicates that missing obstacles lead to unrealistically short routes.
			This is in line with the results of the previous manual route analysis, according to which missing data leads to short but unrealistic routes.

			The route length comparison also supports the previous results, that graph-based routing leads to longer routes with sometimes significant detours, which can be seen in the routing requests 6 and 7 in \Cref{fig:eval-route-distances-rural}.
			But comparing route lengths only yields a vague indication of the route's quality.
			The second metric uses the \term{Hausdorff distance} to quantify the similarity of two routes by determining the maximum distance between them as illustrated in \Cref{fig:hausdorff-distance}.
			\Cref{fig:eval-hausdorff} shows the results for both OSM datasets and yields some insights into the route similarities:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item In both datasets, the average Hausdorff distances of the routes determined using the hybrid routing algorithm are shorter than those of the graph-based algorithm.
				\item The difference is smaller in the city dataset, which supports the aforementioned hypothesis, that the buildings in a city create corridors leading to similar routes for graph-based and geometric routing algorithms.
				\item Except for the routing requests 6 and 7 in the \enquote{OSM rural} datasets, the Hausdorff distances of the routes by the hybrid routing algorithm tend to be larger than the distances of the graph-based routes.
				This is likely due to missing data as discussed in the previous section and illustrated in \Cref{fig:eval-rural-routing-6} leading to shorter but less realistic routes.

		\subsubsection{Route quality analysis summary}
			
			The manual route analysis as well as both mathematical approaches, the comparison to the beeline distance and the Hausdorff distance, yield similar results regarding the quality of routes:
			
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The route quality heavily depends on the data quality.
				Missing data, for example even a small number of missing ditches on farmland or one fence between two larger building, result in shorter but unrealistic routes determined with the hybrid routing algorithm.
				\item Cities and densely built-up areas form corridors through which geometric- and graph-based routing results tend to be very similar.
				\item Graph-based routes between waypoints in rural or remote areas tends to create long detours.
				Such detours often are unrealistic, especially in agent-based models simulating scenarios in which pedestrians do not necessarily respect access restrictions, such as in emergency or evacuation scenarios.
			\end{itemize}
			\noindent
			In scenarios with a high quality in data, for example when using official indoor room plans of buildings or when the data quality is ensured by a manual on-ground survey, the hybrid routing algorithm will likely create high quality routes well reflecting the behavior of real pedestrians.
