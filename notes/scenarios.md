This is a list of possible scenarios.
Each scenarios has to fulfill a set of criteria to be a good scenario.

# Criteria

1. **Scenario must fit to geometric routing.** The situations must handle with open areas or places with bad/few lines for a routing network.
2. **Expect different results.** Simulations using network and geometric routing are expected to lead to different, rather than same results. This is interesting for the evaluation where I want to check exactly that: Does the geometric routing help to create a more accurate simulation of the reality?
3. **Heterogeneity of agents.** Agents are all slightly different, a good scenario makes use of that.
4. **Comprehensibility.** The scenario should be easily understandable, people should be able to relate to it.
5. **Significance.** The scenario should deal with a significant topic (like evacuation of area).

# Scenarios

## Flooded district

### Idea

A district of Hamburg (e.g. Veddel) is hit by a storm flood, some roads are inaccessible and routing through green areas, company ground and other free spaces is necessary for evacuation and traveling of agents. Pure network based routing might be limited in this scenario where some roads and ways are not usable.

### Behavior of agents

Agents move freely and independent through space. Motivation: Legal restrictions (e.g. illegal entering of private property) is unimportant in an emergency situation → movement differs from normal situations.

### Scientific question

### Usefulness of geometric routing

When roads sections are unavailable for network based routing, geometric routing can fill this gap and enable agents to still move towards a target location. This improves the quality of a simulation as it becomes more realistic.

### Complexity of development/modeling

1. Data about flooding needed. Where is the district flooded at certain water levels? Where does the data come from?
2. Algorithm needs to be extended to work with dynamic changes in unavailable areas. It must be possible to dynamically add and remove obstacles. However, the current implementation is tied to the preprocessed visibility graph.

### Evaluation

* Comparison to network based routing possible

### Risks and open questions

* Area of interest is rather large, performance might become an issue?

## HH central station

### Idea

The central station got new stairs at the southern end of the platforms (e.g. this one https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/963178651). This might influence movement of agents which will be analyzed in this scenario.

One can think of several variants of this scenario:

* Evacuation: Do the new stairs help to evacuate a platform (or the whole station) more quickly?
* Changing between train and (local) public transport: Are the stairs helping to reach subway, busses and other trains more quickly? These cases might itself be sub-variants where agents just have different target positions.

### Behavior of agents

Each agent leaves or enters the train at a certain position (→ at door positions from the cars of a train). 

### Scientific question

* Do the new additional stair help? If so, in what situations and in what do they not help?
  * Why are the stair in some situations (or for some agents) not helping?
* Can even more stair improve the situation further? E.g. additional stair in the middle of the station or at the northern end.
* Do different trains have significantly different impact? At some platforms two trains are stopping behind each other, so one is within the station and the second one on the same track is further south.
* Are there big train stations with a good situation for travelers (e.g. terminus stations like Frankfurt). Would a transformation of Hamburg towards a terminus station help?

### Usefulness of geometric routing

Even though train stations have few large open spaces, the platforms are still areas as well as stair and the corridors above and below the station. Using a network limits the movement of agents and movement of agents with in a mass of people can only be roughly approximated.

### Complexity of development/modeling

* The OSM data of the central station can be used even though is needs to be tweaked: Stair must be areas as they are in real life, missing barriers must be added and other obstacles on the platforms need to be added too.
* The routing algorithm must be extended to work with multiple vertical levels of movement. Agents must work with that as well (e.g. collision of agents on different levels must be deactivated, etc.)
* The number and target location of each agent must be approximated or we find exact data on how many people are walking within the station from which to which location.
* A limited number of source and target locations might help to keep things simple and enables us to spawn agents accurately (e.g. every five minutes x many agents spawn in a time span of one minute at that subway exit).

### Evaluation

* Comparison using network based routing possible but ways must probably be added to support this.
* Concrete changes of scenario measurable (e.g. add/remove stairs and see what happens)

### Risks and open questions

* How difficult is the routing with multiple levels?

## Demonstration within the City

Note: This scenario is a bit unclear to me.

### Idea

Multiple agents moving together through the city. Eventually something happens and the agents are moving more individual through the area.

### Behavior of agents

Each agent moves away from a detractor to a new location.

### Scientific question

Possible questions I can think of:

* Can the inner city of hamburg handle panics at large demonstrations?
* How many people can safely move away from a detractor at any location on [Rathausmarkt|Jungfernstieg|Mönckebergstraße|...] without causing a mass panic?

Maybe a colored map can be calculated to see what locations can handle what amount of people.

### Usefulness of geometric routing

In extreme situations people will likely walk whereever they think it's good to go. Maybe even fences aren't obstacles anymore. This behavior cannot be modeled with network based routing as a network has no significance in such situations.

### Complexity of development/modeling

Quite easy because only agents need to be modeled and programmed. The data of OpenStreetMap is probably sufficiently detailed.

### Evaluation

The comparison with a network based simulation is probably possible and would answer the main questions if the agents behavior and the overall result would be significantly different.

### Risks and open questions

* Is the scientific question enough?
* Are the simulations fast enough to calculate a map as mentioned above? Probably not super important but I think such a map would be a great visualization.

## Airport management

### Idea

Airport building also have a lot of open spaces but also several corridors. This scenario should help to determine possible "bottlenecks" regarding the throughput of people.

### Behavior of agents

Several varieties are conceivable:

* Agents walking around the airport, e.g. from public transport to the gates or ticket desks. 
* Agents moving away from a detractor
* Some of the agents moving at once to a different location (e.g. gate of a flight has changed)

### Scientific question

Maybe something like this?

* Is the Hamburg airport ready for extreme situations with above-average amount of moving people?

### Usefulness of geometric routing

Open spaces within the airport (bit also outside the building) are not fully usable with normal network based routing.

### Complexity of development/modeling

Not overly complex. The data situation is interesting as OSM doesn't contain indoor data for the airport.

### Evaluation

Evaluation can be done quite well: Is the same simulation with network based routing determining the same bottlenecks/problems as the geometric routing method?

### Risks and open questions

* Data: Where to get it? OSM doesn't have it. Maybe take a different airport where OSM has good indoor data?
