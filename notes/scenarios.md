This is a list of possible scenarios.
Each scenarios has to fulfill a set of criteria to be a good scenario.

# Criteria

1. Must fit to geometric routing. The situations must handle with open areas or places with bad/few lines for a routing network.
2. Simulations using network and geometric routing are expected to lead to different, rather than same results.
3. Comparison to network based routing must be possible. This is important for evaluation regarding the quality of a simulation based on network routing.
4. Heterogeneity of agents. Agents are all slightly different, a good scenario makes use of that.
