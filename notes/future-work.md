Here are some thoughts on future work:

* Convex hull filtering: Suboptimal for non-shortest (e.g. fastest or otherwise weighted) routes. Solutions:
    * Deactivate filtering. No simple method for non-shortest path weighting is known to me, which results in a simple filtering mechanism.
* 3D data or at least "level" of OSM data
