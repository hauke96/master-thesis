# Master thesis

This repository contains all content for my master thesis *A Hybrid Algorithm for Finding Shortest Paths Between Arbitrary Coordinates using a Combination of Network and Geometric Routing*.

## Branches

* `main`: The main branch on which the actual code and thesis is located.
* `performance-evaluation`: Content of the main branch plus adjustments to the code (measuring performance), used datasets (or scripts to generate them), all measurement results and visualization scripts.
* Other branches: Some features features were tested and abandoned later. They might still exist on other branches.

## Folder structure

* [`code`](./code): the C# solution of the *hybrid routing algorithm* including some example projects.
* [`thesis`](./thesis): Thesis including bibliography and images.
* [`presentation`](./presentation): Presentation of my defense.
* [`notes`](./notes): Personal notes on various things (not necessarily up-to-date).
* [`doc`](./doc): Documentation and additional information on the code. Not necessarily up-to-date but those passages are marked accordingly.
* [`misc`](./misc): Scripts used to measure smaller things mentioned in the thesis.
